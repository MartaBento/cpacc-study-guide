## CPACC Exam Content Outline

The CPACC exam assesses knowledge across three major domains: Disabilities, Challenges, and Assistive Technologies (40%); Accessibility and Universal Design (40%); and Standards, Laws, and Management Strategies (20%). Below is an outline of the content areas covered in the CPACC exam.

---

### I. Disabilities, Challenges, and Assistive Technologies (40%)

#### A. Characterize and Differentiate Between Theoretical Models of Disability

Understanding different models of disability is essential for the CPACC exam. Each model provides a different perspective on disability and its societal implications.

1. **Medical Model**

   - Focuses on diagnosing and treating disability as a condition that needs to be fixed.

2. **Social Model**

   - Views disability as a result of societal barriers, not individual limitations.

3. **Biopsychosocial Model**

   - Combines medical and social perspectives, considering biological, psychological, and social factors.

4. **Economic Model**

   - Examines the impact of disability on the economy, focusing on employment and economic participation.

5. **Functional Solutions Model**

   - Emphasizes functional limitations and finding practical solutions to address them.

6. **Social Identity or Cultural Affiliation Model**

   - Considers disability as part of a person's identity, influenced by cultural and social factors.

7. **Charity Model**
   - Views people with disabilities as objects of charity and pity.

#### B. Demonstrate Understanding of the Categories and Characteristics of Disabilities and Associated Barriers

Disabilities present barriers in both the physical world and in Information and Communication Technology (ICT).

1. **Visual Disabilities**
2. **Auditory Disabilities**
3. **Deaf-blindness**
4. **Speech Disabilities**
5. **Mobility, Flexibility, and Body Structure Disabilities**
6. **Cognitive Disabilities**
7. **Seizure Disabilities**
8. **Psychological/Psychiatric Disabilities**
9. **Multiple/Compound Disabilities**

#### C. Identify Appropriate Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies for Disabilities

Assistive technologies and adaptive strategies help individuals overcome barriers caused by disabilities.

1. **Visual Disabilities Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies**
2. **Auditory Disabilities Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies**
3. **Deaf-Blindness Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies**
4. **Speech Disabilities Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies**
5. **Mobility, Flexibility, and Body Structure Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies**
6. **Seizure Disabilities Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies**
7. **Psychological/Psychiatric Disabilities Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies**
8. **Multiple/Compound Disabilities Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies**

#### D. Demonstrate an Understanding of Disability Demographics and Statistics

Understanding the data trends and implications of disability demographics is critical for designing inclusive environments.

#### E. Apply Disability Etiquette into Practice

Applying proper disability etiquette ensures respectful interaction and accessibility in all environments.

### II. Accessibility and Universal Design (40%)

#### A. Distinguish Between Individualized Accommodations and Universal Design

- **Individualized Accommodations**: Solutions tailored to individuals with specific needs to compensate for shortcomings in mainstream designs.
- **Universal Design**: Designs intended to be used by a wide range of individuals with diverse abilities without the need for adaptation.

#### B. Identify Benefits of Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that people with disabilities have equal opportunities and access to information, services, and environments.

#### C. Identify and Apply Accessibility Principles (from WCAG 2.1) of Web Accessibility

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) provide principles and guidelines to make web content more accessible.

#### D. Identify and Apply Accessibility Principles for the Built Environment

Principles of accessibility are also crucial in the design of physical spaces, ensuring they are usable for people with disabilities.

#### E. Identify and Apply Principles of Universal Design

Universal Design aims to create environments, products, and systems that are usable by all individuals, regardless of ability.

#### F. Identify and Apply Principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL)

- **Define Universal Design for Learning**: UDL provides a framework for creating educational environments that accommodate all learning styles.
- **Define Usability and User Experience (UX)**: Usability and UX principles ensure that systems are designed to be easy and efficient for users to interact with.
