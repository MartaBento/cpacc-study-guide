## Overview

Theoretical models of disability provide perspectives and frameworks to understand disability. No model is comprehensive and can be fully correct or incorrect. In practice, organizations generally use aspects of multiple models, particularly the social and medical models.

---

### 1. Medical Model

**Definitions**

From Disabled World:  
"The medical model is presented as viewing disability as a problem of the person, directly caused by disease, trauma, or other health condition which therefore requires sustained medical care provided in the form of individual treatment by professionals. In the medical model, management of the disability is aimed at a ‘cure,’ or the individual’s adjustment and behavioral change that would lead to an ‘almost-cure’ or effective cure. In the medical model, medical care is viewed as the main issue, and at the political level, the principal response is that of modifying or reforming health care policy."

From Disability Australia Hub:  
“The medical model of disability sees disability as a ‘problem’ that belongs to the individual. It isn’t seen as an issue for others, just the person who is affected. For example, if a student using a wheelchair is unable to get into a building because of some steps, the medical model would suggest that this is because of the person’s physical disability, rather than the steps.”

**Strengths**

- The medical model can address the biological sources of disabilities, either by clinically curing them or providing ways to medically manage conditions.
- The medical component of disabilities is a critical reality for many people.

**Weaknesses**

- The medical model treats disability as a problem or inherent characteristic of the individual.
- It seeks a cure or medical management of a bodily condition.
- The medical model often overlooks issues caused by unwelcoming or inaccessible environments or “broader sociopolitical constraints including attitudes, policies and (lack of) regulations.”
- One result of the common medical understanding of disability is that people with disabilities often report feeling excluded, undervalued, pressured to fit a questionable norm, and/or treated as if they were globally incapacitated. People with disabilities often express frustration when they are met with pitying attitudes or incredulity if they speak about anything positive related to living with their conditions.

### 2. Social Model

**Definitions**

From Disability Hub Australia:  
“The social model of disability says that the way society is conceptualised causes disability, rather than a person’s impairment or difference. It looks at ways of removing barriers that restrict life choices for people with disabilities. When barriers are removed, people with disability can be independent and equal in society, with choice and control over their own lives.”

From Disabled World:  
“The social model of disability sees the issue of ‘disability’ as a socially created problem and a matter of the full integration of individuals into society. In this model, disability is not an attribute of an individual, but rather a complex collection of conditions, many of which are created by the social environment. Hence, the management of the problem requires social action and is the collective responsibility of society at large to make the environmental modifications necessary for the full participation of people with disabilities in all areas of social life. The issue is both cultural and ideological, requiring individual, community, and large-scale social change. From this perspective, equal access for someone with an impairment/disability is a human rights issue of major concern.”

From the UK Ombudsman:  
“According to the social model a person does not ‘have’ a disability – disability is something a person experiences. The disability experienced is often caused by the approach taken by society/individuals which fails to take account of people with impairments and their associated needs. This can result in people with impairments being excluded from mainstream society. For example, an individual is not prevented from reading a magazine because of blindness, but because of the absence of alternative formats. A person is not prevented from going to see a play because they are a wheelchair user rather it is the absence of accessible transport and access to venues that causes the disability and exclusion. The social model of disability also focuses on people’s attitudes towards disability and recognises that attitudes towards disability can present barriers for disabled people in the same way the physical environment can. These attitudes are many and varied, ranging from prejudice and stereotyping to unnecessary inflexible organisational practices and procedures and seeing disabled people as objects of pity/charity.”

**Strengths**

- The social model’s focus on the disabling conditions in society and the environment emphasizes that barriers and challenges experienced by people with disabilities are not inevitable, nor exclusively a characteristic of an individual’s “broken” body.
- Societies can improve the lives of people with disabilities considerably by ensuring the world is designed to accommodate a wide range of human characteristics and abilities.

**Weaknesses**

- The social model of disability can downplay the embodied aspects of disabilities, as if disability has nothing to do with bodily characteristics at all.
- The social model’s push for social justice in the political arena can also put activists at odds with people with other political interests, antagonizing relationships and sometimes creating resolute political adversaries.

### 3. Biopsychosocial Model

**Definitions**

From Physio-Pedia:  
“The Biopsychosocial Model of disability is an attempt to account for both the social and biomedical models of disability. First conceptualized by George Engel in 1977, it suggests that to understand a person’s medical condition it is not simply the biological factors that need to be considered, but also the psychological and social factors:

- Bio (physiological pathology)
- Psycho (thoughts, emotions, and behaviors such as psychological distress, fear/avoidance beliefs, current coping methods and attribution)
- Social (socio-economical, socio-environmental, and cultural factors such as work issues, family circumstances and benefits/economics)”  
  In 2002, the World Health Organization published the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). The ICF describes the complex phenomenon of disability and integrates the social and medical models. It is derived from the biopsychosocial model of disability.

**Strengths**

- The biopsychosocial model can be used in situations related to rehabilitation.
- Within the medical model, doctors traditionally focus on medical cures and areas of pathology and impairment. This medical approach stands in contrast to the participation-based approach of health and social care professionals.
- In the biopsychosocial model, a rehabilitation team would integrate both aspects to develop a support intervention that accounts for both a person’s medical and social situation.

**Weaknesses**

- There are fears that the combination of health aspects with the social model in the World Health Organisation International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) would lead to a definition of disability as only being the result of societal factors, thus downplaying the medical needs of people with disabilities.
- The classification is also complex, which could lead to difficulties in implementation.

### 4. Economic Model

**Definition**

From Disabled World:  
“The economic model of disability defines disability by a person’s inability to participate in work. It also assesses the degree to which impairment affects an individual’s productivity and the economic consequences for the individual, employer, and the state. Such consequences include loss of earnings for and payment for assistance by the individual; lower profit margins for the employer; and state welfare payments. This model is directly related to the charity model.”  
The economic model is used by policymakers in the context of determining and assessing disability benefits.

**Strengths**

- The economic model recognizes the effect of bodily limitations on a person’s ability to work, and that may require economic support and/or accommodations for the person’s disability.

**Weaknesses**

- The economic model creates a legally defined category of people who are needy, which can be stigmatizing. Additionally, if a person doesn’t meet the legal “disabled” threshold, or if there is a dispute about a person’s disability, the person with the disability may not receive the support they need.

### 5. Functional Solutions Model

**Definition**

From Handwiki:  
“The functional solutions model of disability is a practical perspective that identifies the limitations (or ‘functional impairments’) due to disability, with the intent to create and promote solutions to overcome those limitations. The primary task is to eliminate, or at least reduce, the impact of the functional limitations of the body through technological or methodological innovation.”  
The work of accessibility professionals can be viewed through the lens of this model.

**Strengths**

- This model is results-oriented. It seeks to solve real-world challenges, attends to the needs of people in their own circumstances and is based on providing services.

**Weaknesses**

- Profit-driven technology entrepreneurs can sometimes miss the mark, creating products that may be innovative but neither practical nor useful. Some products may be of more benefit to the innovators than to the target population, especially if they are expensive.
- A narrow focus on technology may lead to miscalculations or missed opportunities in cases where social, political and environmental aspects ought to be considered to fix an issue effectively.

### 6. Social Identity or Cultural Affiliation Model

**Definition**  
The social identity or cultural affiliation model refers to a sense of deriving one’s personal identity from membership within a group of like-minded individuals. This model is most evident among people who are deaf. Deaf culture and identity owe much of its strengths to the somewhat exclusive nature of being a part of a close-knit linguistic minority. Other people with disabilities may also feel a sense of belonging to a community with common life experiences.

**Strengths**

- The social identity or cultural affiliation model accepts the person’s disability completely and uses it as a point of pride in associating with other people in a similar condition.

**Weaknesses**

- The sense of belonging felt within a group of people can be counterbalanced by feelings of exclusion for people who don’t fit the group’s expectations.

---

### 7. Charity Model

**Definition**
The charity model regards people with disabilities as unfortunate and in need of assistance. People with disabilities are viewed as dependent on the generosity of others.

**Strengths**

- The charity model can mobilize people to act benevolently toward others by offering help and financial assistance. There is a place for this model in providing short-term help or charity for individuals who are in immediate need.

**Weaknesses**

- People with disabilities in the charity model are often treated as objects of pity. This may result in people being seen as less than human, unable to live full, independent, or active lives. Furthermore, charity does not often address the long-term needs or systemic changes required to foster inclusion for people with disabilities.

## Note

No model is comprehensive or complete. It’s important to take elements from each model to create a complete and effective approach to disability and accessibility.
